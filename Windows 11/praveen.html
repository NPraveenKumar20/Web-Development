        <h2>About Windows:-</h2>
        <p>The first versions of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were graphical shells that ran from MS-DOS.<br>
            Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system. Windows 95 also had a
            significant<br>
            amount of 16-bit code ported from Windows 3.1. Windows 95 introduced many features that have been<br>
            part of the product ever since, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File
            Explorer in Windows 8).</p>
